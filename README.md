## About The Project

Hey, there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Luca, a 19-year-old tech enthusiast living in Germany. 

This is a **cheat-sheet** of my personal knowledge-base, based around computer stuff. Here you'll find code-snippets, technical documentation, and command reference for various tools and technologies.

You can support my work on [buy me a coffe](https://buymeacoffee.com/lucagaerisch) if you want.

> âš  Be careful, some documents may be out of date due as newer versions are constantly being published.
