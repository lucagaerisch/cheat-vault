## About The Project

Hey, there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Luca, a 19-year-old tech enthusiast living in Germany. 

This is a **cheat-sheet** of my personal knowledge base, centered on computer-related topics. Here you'll find code snippets, technical documentation, and command references for various tools and technologies.

You can support my work on [buy me a coffe](https://buymeacoffee.com/lucagaerisch) if you want.

> âš  Be aware that some documents may be out of date due to the fact that newer versions are constantly being published.
